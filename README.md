# Getting Started with Create React App
 FRONTEND -Use create-react-app to generate starter code for your your project. Follow the instructions on the create-react-app.site to get started.
 BACKEND -Create a db.json file with a structure in the root of your project.
 Use the command "json-server --watch db.json" to set up the server.

# Requirements
Make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app
App should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized
There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-routerLinks to an external site.
Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
